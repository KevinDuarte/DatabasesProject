        <section>

            <p> University Events is a website dedicated to providing students with information of events
                occuring on the University they attend. This website allows students to view events in their location, or
                by the University they want to see the events from. Students can retrieve events according to their level of access or scope. 
                A student should be able to see all the events around their location or from RSOs they are following. Students can create a RSO
                or join an existing one. A new RSO can only be created with at least five other students from the same University.
